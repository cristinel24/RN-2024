For self-study (all students): 
* [But what is a convolution?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA)
* https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html

Homework: 
* Use the following environment: https://github.com/markub3327/flappy-bird-gymnasium.
* Train a Reinforcement Learning agent using Q-Learning  (or Actor Critic).
* You may use PyTorch for the network but must implement the training algorithm yourselves.
* You should train the agent using images (otherwise you get partial points).
* Teams of 2 people.
